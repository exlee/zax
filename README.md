**Z**ig utils by **A**le**x**ander.

It also sounds a little bit like Zig Axe if you [lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))

## Usage

See the docs on [Github Pages](https://exlee.github.io/zax/)

I wouldn't suggest importing it directly, but rather copy&paste or check it out.
There are some recipies I found useful and some ideas I entertained while doing this.

Most are simple helpers I use in my other project.
